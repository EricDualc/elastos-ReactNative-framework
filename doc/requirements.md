## Requirements

### High-Level Requirements
- Since we have a C++ SDK to work with, we can write plugins for wallet, carrier and DID in react native and flutter frameworks 
- Can force react native app without http. This needs to be improved still however. Research needs to be done for flutter if a similar thing is possible
- The same thing applies for any kind of framework we decide to use in the future
- Flutter plugin development: https://flutter.io/developing-packages/ 
- React Native plugin development: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios
